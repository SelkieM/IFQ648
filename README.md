Elliptic curve cryptography 
Consider the elliptic curve E/Fp : y2 = x3 + ax + b with modulus p = 13 and coefficients a = 5 and b = 9
Also consider the following two points given by their (x, y) coordinates modulo p: G = (7, 7) and H = (12,9).

Find out the point G+H, proceeding geometrically by working on the graph you drew in the first subpart
(this requires your graph to be reasonably to scale along each coordinate taken separately). Explain what
you are doing; you may directly draw on your graph if that helps.
